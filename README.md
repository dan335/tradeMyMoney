# Trade My Money Discord Bot

Can Discord beat the stock market?  Trade stocks and make me money.  Or lose it.  Please don't lose it all.

Use **$buy symbol** and **$sell symbol** to cast a vote on what action the bot should do next.  Every 5 minutes the bot will pick the action with the most votes and execute it.  If votes are equal then it chooses the oldest one.  Use **$account** to see the value of the account and **$positions** to see held positions.  Use **$commands** to see all of the commands.

Made for Discord's hack week.

Trades are made with Alpaca's API. https://alpaca.markets  Works with real or paper money.
